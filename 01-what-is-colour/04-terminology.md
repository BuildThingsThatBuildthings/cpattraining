# Essential Light and Colour Terminology

## Core Measurements and Terms

Understanding the technical language of light and colour helps practitioners communicate effectively with clients and other healthcare providers. These terms form the foundation for professional colour therapy practice.

### Wavelength (nm)
Wavelength is the distance between successive peaks of a light wave, measured in nanometers (nm). Each colour corresponds to a specific wavelength range:

- **Red**: ~620-700 nm (longest visible wavelengths)
- **Orange**: ~590-620 nm  
- **Yellow**: ~570-590 nm
- **Green**: ~495-570 nm
- **Blue**: ~450-495 nm
- **Violet**: ~380-450 nm (shortest visible wavelengths)

### Frequency (Hz)
Frequency refers to how many wave cycles occur per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequency means more energy per photon. Frequency and wavelength are inversely related—as wavelength increases, frequency decreases.

This relationship helps explain why different colours have different therapeutic properties and why higher frequency colours (blue, violet) can feel more energizing.

> **CPAT** — When explaining frequency to clients, emphasize the positive: "Each colour vibrates at its own perfect frequency to support your body's natural healing rhythms."

### Coherence
Coherence describes how organized or synchronized light waves are. Highly coherent light has waves that are perfectly aligned and travel together. Laser light is highly coherent, while regular light bulbs produce incoherent light.

In therapeutic applications, coherence affects:
- Penetration depth into tissues
- Intensity of biological effects  
- Precision of delivery
- Duration of therapeutic effects

### Monochromaticity  
Monochromaticity refers to light that contains only one colour or a very narrow range of wavelengths. Pure monochromatic light is rare—most "single colour" sources actually contain a small range of wavelengths around the target colour.

Benefits of monochromatic light in therapy:
- Precise targeting of specific biological responses
- Consistent therapeutic effects
- Reduced risk of overstimulation
- Clear documentation and replication of treatments

> **Practice** — Understanding these terms helps you select appropriate devices and explain treatment parameters to clients. Always begin with relaxation breathing (5–10 minutes) to prepare the body to receive precisely calibrated colour therapy.

### Saturation
Saturation describes how pure or vivid a colour appears. Highly saturated colours appear rich and intense, while desaturated colours appear pale or washed out. In therapeutic contexts:

- **High saturation**: More intense biological and psychological effects
- **Low saturation**: Gentler, more subtle therapeutic responses  
- **Variable saturation**: Allows for customized treatment intensity

### Intensity (Lumens)
Intensity measures the brightness or power of light, often expressed in lumens. In colour therapy, intensity affects:

- How deeply light penetrates tissues
- The strength of biological responses
- Client comfort and safety
- Duration of therapeutic effects

Proper intensity management is crucial for safe, effective treatment.

> **Safety** — Always start with low intensity settings and gradually increase as tolerated. Monitor client responses carefully, especially with higher intensity applications. Never use high intensity light without proper training and equipment.

## Practical Application Guide

| Term | What to Monitor | Clinical Significance |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Wavelength | Colour accuracy | Determines specific therapeutic effects |
| Frequency | Energy level | Affects stimulation vs. sedation |
| Coherence | Light quality | Influences penetration and precision |
| Monochromaticity | Colour purity | Ensures consistent therapeutic responses |
| Saturation | Colour vibrancy | Controls treatment intensity |
| Intensity | Brightness level | Critical for safety and effectiveness |

## Communication with Clients

When discussing these technical aspects with clients, use accessible language:

- **Wavelength** → "Each colour has its own specific energy signature"
- **Frequency** → "How fast the colour energy vibrates"  
- **Coherence** → "How organized and focused the light is"
- **Monochromaticity** → "Pure, single colours for precise effects"
- **Saturation** → "How rich and vibrant the colour appears"
- **Intensity** → "Brightness level—always adjustable for your comfort"

> **CPAT** — Frame technical explanations positively: "These precise measurements help us deliver exactly the right colour energy to support your healing goals."

## Documentation Standards

Professional practice requires accurate documentation using these terms:

- Record specific wavelengths used
- Note intensity settings and duration
- Document client responses to different frequencies
- Track effectiveness of various saturation levels
- Maintain consistent terminology across sessions

## Integration with CLAS Approach

These technical terms support the scientific foundation of CLAS therapy while maintaining the gentle, holistic approach:

- Precise measurement enables safe, effective treatment
- Professional terminology supports credibility with other healthcare providers
- Understanding mechanisms enhances practitioner confidence
- Technical accuracy ensures consistent, replicable results

> **Practice** — End all technical discussions with grounding techniques. Use alertness breathing (~5 minutes) to help clients integrate new information and return to a centered state.

## Key Terms Summary

- **Wavelength (nm)**: Distance between wave peaks; determines colour
- **Frequency (Hz)**: Wave cycles per second; affects energy level
- **Coherence**: Wave organization; influences penetration
- **Monochromaticity**: Colour purity; enables precise targeting
- **Saturation**: Colour intensity; controls treatment strength  
- **Intensity (lumens)**: Brightness; critical for safety

Mastering these terms enhances professional practice while supporting the compassionate, client-centered approach that defines effective CLAS therapy.
