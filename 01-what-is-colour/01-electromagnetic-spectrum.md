# The Electromagnetic Spectrum

## Visible and Invisible Light

The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all forms of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves with very long wavelengths to gamma rays with extremely short wavelengths. The colours we can see with our eyes represent only a tiny portion of this vast spectrum—approximately 380 to 700 nanometers.

This visible portion includes the familiar rainbow colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each colour corresponds to a specific range of wavelengths, with red having the longest visible wavelengths and violet the shortest.

## Beyond What We Can See

While our eyes can only detect this narrow band of visible light, the electromagnetic spectrum extends far beyond our visual capabilities in both directions:

**Longer wavelengths (beyond red):**
- Infrared radiation (heat)
- Microwaves  
- Radio waves

**Shorter wavelengths (beyond violet):**
- Ultraviolet radiation
- X-rays
- Gamma rays

> **Safety** — Ultraviolet and infrared radiation require special caution. Always use appropriate filters and devices designed for therapeutic use. Never expose clients to unfiltered UV or intense infrared without proper equipment and training.

## Therapeutic Implications

Understanding the broader electromagnetic spectrum helps us appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of colour therapy. While we primarily work with visible light in CLAS therapy, it's important to recognize that:

- Some therapeutic light devices may include near-infrared wavelengths for deeper tissue penetration
- The body responds to electromagnetic energy beyond just the visible spectrum
- Safety protocols must account for both visible and invisible radiation

> **CPAT** — When explaining the spectrum to clients, emphasize the wonder and precision of natural light: "Your body has an amazing capacity to respond beneficially to the full spectrum of healing light energy."

## Practical Applications

In therapeutic settings, we focus primarily on the visible spectrum because:

- It's the range our visual system is designed to process
- Visible light provides sufficient energy for therapeutic effects
- It can be safely delivered through standard lighting equipment
- Clients can actively participate in the experience through visualization and conscious awareness

> **Practice** — When introducing spectrum concepts, use simple demonstrations like prisms or colored filters to help clients understand how white light contains all colours. This builds confidence in the natural therapeutic process.

## Key Spectrum Facts for Practitioners

- Visible light: approximately 380-700 nanometers
- Red light: longest visible wavelengths (~700 nm)
- Violet light: shortest visible wavelengths (~380 nm)
- Each colour represents a specific energy frequency
- Therapeutic effects occur within the visible range
- Safety protocols apply to all electromagnetic radiation

The electromagnetic spectrum provides the scientific foundation for understanding how colour therapy works, while the visible portion offers a safe and effective range for therapeutic applications with proper training and equipment.
