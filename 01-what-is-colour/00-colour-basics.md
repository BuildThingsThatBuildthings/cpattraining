# What is Colour?

## Understanding Colour as Energy

Colour is not just what we see—it's a fundamental form of energy that exists within the electromagnetic spectrum. When we talk about colour in therapeutic contexts, we're referring to specific wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes and bodies can perceive and respond to.

At its most basic level, colour is light energy vibrating at different frequencies. Each colour we experience corresponds to a specific range of wavelengths measured in nanometers (nm). This energy doesn't just create visual experiences—it can influence biological and psychological processes in the human body.

> **Safety** — Before working with any colour or light therapy techniques, always screen clients for epilepsy or seizure history. CLAS/light exposure is contraindicated for these conditions.

## The Relationship Between Light and Colour

Light and colour are inseparably connected. White light contains all colours within it, which becomes visible when light passes through a prism and separates into the familiar rainbow spectrum. This demonstrates that colour is not something separate from light, but rather light expressing itself at different vibrational frequencies.

When we work with specific colours in therapeutic settings, we are working with focused bands of light energy. This energy can be delivered to the body through various pathways—primarily through the eyes and skin—where it can influence biological processes.

> **CPAT** — When introducing colour concepts to clients, use affirming language: "You have the natural ability to respond to colour's beneficial energy" rather than focusing on problems or deficiencies.

## Colour in CLAS Therapy Context

Within the CLAS (Colour, Light, Aromatherapy, Sound) approach, colour serves as one of the four therapeutic pillars. Colour therapy works synergistically with the other modalities to create gentle, effective healing experiences.

Understanding colour as energy helps us appreciate why it can be such a powerful therapeutic tool. When we expose the body to specific colours, we're providing targeted energy that can support natural healing processes and emotional well-being.

> **Practice** — All colour therapy sessions should begin with relaxation breathing (5–10 minutes) and end with grounding/alertness breathing (~5 minutes) to ensure client safety and integration.

## Key Points to Remember

- Colour is electromagnetic energy at specific frequencies
- Each colour corresponds to a particular wavelength range
- Colour affects both visual and non-visual biological pathways
- Therapeutic colour work requires proper safety screening
- Colour is one pillar in the integrated CLAS approach

The foundational understanding that colour equals energy helps us approach colour therapy with both scientific awareness and therapeutic wisdom, always prioritizing client safety and positive outcomes.
