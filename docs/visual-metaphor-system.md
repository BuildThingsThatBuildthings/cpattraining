## 🎨 ICONOGRAPHY DESIGN SYSTEM

### Design Principles for CPAT Icons

#### Organic Over Geometric
**Instead of:** Sharp edges, rigid rectangles, clinical symbols
**Use:** Rounded corners, flowing lines, nature-inspired forms

**Examples:**
- Progress bars with rounded ends and flowing fills
- Buttons with soft, pebble-like shapes
- Cards with organic, leaf-like rounded corners

#### Growth Over Static
**Instead of:** Fixed, unchanging symbols
**Use:** Implied movement, growth directions, transformation

**Examples:**
- Arrows that curve naturally rather than sharp angles
- Icons that suggest upward growth or forward movement
- Elements that feel alive and dynamic

#### Warm Over Cool
**Instead of:** Cold blues, harsh blacks, sterile whites
**Use:** Earth tones, warm neutrals, nature-inspired colors

**Examples:**
- Icons using sage, terracotta, and gold tones
- Soft shadows that feel warm, not harsh
- Gradients that suggest natural light

#### Inclusive Over Exclusive  
**Instead of:** Intimidating professional symbols
**Use:** Welcoming, accessible imagery that invites participation

**Examples:**
- Open rather than closed shapes
- Inclusive human representations
- Accessible, universally understood symbols
