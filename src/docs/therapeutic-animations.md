# CPAT Therapeutic Animation Library

## Overview

The CPAT Therapeutic Animation Library transforms flashy, anxiety-inducing animations into sophisticated, calming micro-interactions that support the luxury wellness platform aesthetic. These animations are designed to reduce stress, support therapeutic contexts, and create a premium spa-like digital experience.

## Animation Psychology Principles

### 1. Breathing-Based Timing
- All animations follow natural breathing patterns (2-3 second cycles)
- Timing matches therapeutic breathing exercises
- Creates subconscious calming effects

### 2. Organic Movement
- Movements feel natural rather than mechanical
- Subtle scaling and gentle floating motions
- No jarring or startling transitions

### 3. Therapeutic Color Palette
- Sage greens that promote healing and balance
- Soft, muted tones instead of bright, energizing colors
- Color transitions that reduce visual fatigue

### 4. Reduced Intensity
- Gentle movements that don't compete for attention
- Subtle effects that support rather than distract
- Premium restraint over flashy displays

## Core Animation Classes

### Therapeutic Reveals
```css
.fade-in-up          /* Gentle reveal with subtle blur effect */
.slide-in-right      /* Organic slide with scaling */
.soft-reveal         /* Ultra-gentle appearance */
```

### Breathing Animations
```css
.breathing-light     /* Matches natural breathing rhythm */
.gentle-pulse        /* Calming notification pulse */
.therapeutic-glow    /* Sage-based glow effect */
```

### Floating Elements
```css
.floating            /* Gentle floating motion */
.mindful-focus       /* Encourages presence and attention */
.calming-wave        /* Subtle wave-like movement */
```

### Interactive Elements
```css
.therapeutic-button  /* Premium button micro-interactions */
.therapeutic-card    /* Sophisticated card hover states */
.organic-hover       /* Natural hover transitions */
```

### Progress & Loading
```css
.therapeutic-progress    /* Anxiety-reducing progress bars */
.therapeutic-loading     /* Calming loading states */
.therapeutic-skeleton    /* Gentle skeleton screens */
```

### Special Effects
```css
.serenity-glow          /* Spa-like color transitions */
.zenith-ripple          /* Meditation-inspired ripples */
.healing-glow           /* Updated therapeutic aura */
```

## Timing Variables

### Therapeutic Transitions
```css
--transition-fast: 300ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
--transition-base: 600ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
--transition-slow: 900ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
--transition-breath: 1200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)
--transition-organic: 800ms cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)
--transition-therapeutic: 2400ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
```

## Implementation Examples

### Therapeutic Button
```jsx
<button className="btn-primary therapeutic-button">
  Complete Session
</button>
```

### Floating Icon
```jsx
<div className="floating gentle-pulse">
  <div className="w-16 h-16 bg-sage-primary rounded-full">
    üåø
  </div>
</div>
```

### Progressive Reveal
```jsx
<div className="therapeutic-card fade-in-up stagger-2">
  <div className="breathing-light">Content</div>
</div>
```

### Calming Progress Bar
```jsx
<div className="therapeutic-progress h-2 bg-gray-200 rounded-full">
  <div className="h-full bg-gradient-to-r from-sage-primary to-sage-light w-3/4"></div>
</div>
```

## Staggered Animation Delays

For sequential reveals that don't overwhelm:
```css
.stagger-1 { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.stagger-2 { animation-delay: 0.2s; }
.stagger-3 { animation-delay: 0.3s; }
.stagger-4 { animation-delay: 0.4s; }
.stagger-5 { animation-delay: 0.5s; }
.stagger-6 { animation-delay: 0.6s; }
```

## Accessibility Features

### Reduced Motion Support
All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:
- Animations are disabled for sensitive users
- Hover effects are minimized
- Focus states remain functional

### Performance Optimized
- CSS animations preferred over JavaScript
- GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Optimized for 60fps on mobile devices
- Fallback states for older browsers

## Color Psychology

### Sage Green Palette
- **Primary**: #A8C09A - Healing and growth
- **Light**: #C8B8DB - Serenity and calm  
- **Dark**: #6B7D6A - Stability and grounding

### Therapeutic Benefits
- Reduces eye strain and visual fatigue
- Promotes feelings of safety and healing
- Creates professional, premium aesthetic
- Supports therapeutic context without clinical coldness

## Animation Guidelines

### Do's
‚úÖ Use breathing-based timing (2-3 second cycles)
‚úÖ Keep movements subtle and organic
‚úÖ Layer animations with staggered delays
‚úÖ Test on mobile devices for performance
‚úÖ Include reduced motion fallbacks

### Don'ts
‚ùå Use flashy or attention-grabbing effects
‚ùå Create animations faster than 300ms
‚ùå Layer too many effects simultaneously
‚ùå Use bright, energizing colors
‚ùå Ignore accessibility preferences
